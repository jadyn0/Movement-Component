# Movement-Component

This component adds dynamic movement. The camera can freely move around the player, and the player will turn to face the direction of movement. The camera also uses rays to stop it from clipping into the ground. The player movement is done by using rigidbodies, and detects whether they are standing on the floor, so that they are able to jump. if left shift is held down, the player will sprint and move 1.5x faster.
